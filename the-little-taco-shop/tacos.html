        <h3>Taco Trivia</h3>
        <div>
            <details>
                <summary>When did tacos first appear in United States?</summary>
                <p>The Taco was first introduced to the United States in 1905.
                    Mexican migrants were coming in to work on railroads and other
                    jobs and started to bring their delicious food with them. Tacos
                    were essentially a street food at this time since they were highly
                    portable and cheap. (source:
